This is a Pet Diary App made from React and Redux with Rail as backend

## Setting Up

```
 cd backend 
 bundle install
```
Then
```
cd frontend
npm install
```

Once both front and back end are setting up, we will also need to run `rails s` in the backend to access our data and `npm start` in the frontend for our page to load in http://localhost:3000.
